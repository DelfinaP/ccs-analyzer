
This directory contains subdirectories which contain CWB-NC examples 
implemented in the various design languages currently supported by
the CWB-NC.  Each example has a corresponding subdirectory which
contains files with the following suffixes:

  .ccs     A ccs implementation of the system(s) and specification(s).
  .pccs    A prioritized ccs implementation of the system(s) and 
           specification(s). 
  .tccs    A timed ccs implementation of the system(s) and 
           specification(s). 
  .csp     A csp implementation of the system(s) and specification(s).
  .lotos   A lotos implementation of the system(s) and specification(s). 
  .sccs    A synchronized ccs implementation of the system(s) and
	   specification(s)

  .mu      Contains mu-calculus formulas that formulate various 
           properties the system should have.

  .cws     (C)oncurrency (W)orkbench (S)cript.  This file contains a 
           sequence of CWB-NC commands to perform various analyses 
           for the example.

  .cws.out This file conains the output generated when the .cws 
           file is executed (i.e. cwb-nc> es foo.cws foo.cws.out).
