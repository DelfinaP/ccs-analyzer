
\manpage{semantics}{semantics semantic-type}
{
  The "semantics" command sets the mode for computing transitions
  in the simulator.  The two available "semantic-type" arguments are
  "bisim" and "obseq".  The two different modes treat internal 
  actions differently.  In "bisim" (bisimulation) mode internal 
  actions are treated exactly as visible actions.  In "obseq" 
  (observational equivalence) mode the transitions displayed
  are those that may be taken from the current system state by
  performing zero or more internal actions followed by some action
  (either visible or internal) followed by zero or more internal 
  actions.
