{
     chk invokes the model checker to determine whether or not
     "agent" satisfies "formula".  The currently supported temporal
     logics for the specification of formulas are the mu-calculus
     (-L mu, which is the default) and GCTL* (-L gctl).  The -O option
     indicates that model-checking is to be on-the-fly, if possible.
     Global model-checking, if possible, is the default.  At this time,
     global model-checking is not possible for GCTL* formulas and is only
     available for alternation-free mu-calculus formulas.
