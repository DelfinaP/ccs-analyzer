
\manpage{search}{search agent formula}
{
    search invokes the CWB-NC reachability analysis routine.
    Given an agent and a formula the routine searches the set
    of reachable states in the agent for a state satisfying the 
    given formula.  If such a state is found, the simulator is 
    invoked with a path to the state pre-loaded.  The formula 
    may be any mu-calculus (or CTL) formula supported by the 
    CWB-NC model checkers; however, in most cases it will be 
    a Hennessy-Milner Logic (HML) formula that may be checked very 
    quickly at each state.  Note that a HML formula is simply 
    a mu-calculus formula that contains no fix point operators
    or weak modalities.
