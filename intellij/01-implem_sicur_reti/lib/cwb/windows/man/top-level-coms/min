
\manpage{min}{ min [-S semantic-type] agent identifier}
{
    min minimizes agent with respect to the equivalence relation
    indicated by semantic-type (obseq by default) and binds
    the resulting agent to identifier.  The currently available 
    semantic type arguments are obseq (observational equivalence) 
    and bisim (strong bisimulation equivalence).
