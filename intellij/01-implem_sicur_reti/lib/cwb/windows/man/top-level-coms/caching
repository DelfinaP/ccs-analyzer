{
    The "caching" command toggles whether or not transitions
    are cached during analysis.  "arg" is either "on" or "off"
    When caching is on, the transitions of subterms of the parallel 
    composition operator are cached as they are computed, which usually 
    leads to impressive speedups since these are recomputed numerous 
    times for a typical design.  However, if the subterms of a parallel 
    composition operator are automata (as is the case when doing component 
    wise minimization) caching is unnecessary and wastes space, therefore 
    should not be used.
