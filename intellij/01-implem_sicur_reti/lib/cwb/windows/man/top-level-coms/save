
\manpage{save}{save filename [ identifier ... ]}
{
    The save command saves the bindings in the current environment,
    or selected bindings, to a file.  If one or more identifier
    arguments are given, then the bindings for these identifiers 
    are saved to filename.  If no identifier arguments are given,
    then all bindings in the environment are saved to a file. The
    save command is useful for saving minimized automata for future
    use.
