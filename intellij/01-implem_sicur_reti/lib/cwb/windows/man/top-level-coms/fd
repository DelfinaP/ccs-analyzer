{
    chk invokes the model checker to determine whether or not 
    agent satisfies formula.  If the formula is alternation-
    free then a global model checker is invoked; otherwise,
    if the formula is in the L2 fragment of the mu-calculus,
    then an on-the-fly model checker is invoked.  Formulas in 
    neither of these fragments are not yet handled.
