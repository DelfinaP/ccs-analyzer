{
    eq computes whether agent1 and agent2 are related by the 
    equivalence relation indicated by semantic-type (obseq by
    default).  The currently available semantic-type arguments
    are obseq (observational equivalence), bisim (strong 
    bisimulation equivalence), trace (trace equivalence),
    may (may equivalence), and must (must equivalence).
